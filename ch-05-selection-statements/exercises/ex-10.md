What output does the following program fragment produce?
(Assume that i is an integervariable.)  

```c
i = 1;
switch (i % 3) {
    case 0: printf("zero");
    case 1: printf("one");
    case 2: printf("two");
}
```

**answer**  

onetwo.

since result is 1 program executes case 1 then falls
through to case 2 because case 1 doesnt have a break statment.

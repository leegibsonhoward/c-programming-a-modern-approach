# Chapter 1 - Introducing C

What is c?

A widely used programming language developed in the early 70's at Bell Laboratories.


1.1

- C is a by-product of the UNIX operating system.

- Developed by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie and others.

- The original version of UNIX ran on a DEC PDP-7(early minicomputer with 8k words of main memory, circa 1969)

- UNIX was written in assembly language which was painful to debug so thomplson a higher level language was needed for UNIX. So he created B language.  

- B language was based on BCPL. But b wesnt good enough so he extended B and called it NB "New B"

- Ken Thompson then change the name to c since it diverged a significant amount.

- C provided portability and allowed c programs to run on different hardware.

- The first book on C was "The C programming Language". this was in 1978. Also known as the "White Book"

- C standardization began in 1983. Named ANSI, National Standards Institue.

- the standard was completed in 1988 and formally approved in December 1989 as ANSI
standard X3.159-1989

- More significant changes occurred with the publication
of a new standard, ISO/IEC 9899:1999, in 1999. The language described in this
standard is commonly known as C99


- Many modern day languages borrowed alot of features from c.

- learning C can give you greater insight into the features of C++, Java, C#, Perl, and
the other C-based languages.


1.2

- C is low level and provides access to machine-level concepts such as bytes and addresses.

- C is small. Language reference manual is only 49 pages.

- C is permissive. doesn’t mandate the detailed error-checking found in other languages.

Strengths  

- C was intended for applications where assembly language had tradi-
tionally been used

- portability wasn’t a primary goal of C (there’s nothing to prevent programmers from writing nonportable programs)

- It’s often possible to accomplish quite a bit with just a few lines of code.

Weaknesses

- C programs are error-prone

- programmers who are too clever for their own good can make programs almost impossible to understand.

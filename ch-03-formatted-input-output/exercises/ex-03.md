Suppose that we call scanf as follows:
`scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);`

If the user enters
`12.3 45.6 789`

what will be the values of x, i, and y after the call? (Assume that x and y are float vari-
ables and i is an int variable.)

A: 12.3 45 .6  

The last value of `.6` is because `45.6` is a float value but the variable type is int so it
reaches the `.` and puts it back.

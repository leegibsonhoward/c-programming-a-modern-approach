If i and j are positive integers, does (-i)/j always have the same value as -(i/j)? Jus-
tify your answer.  

Not in C89. Suppose that i is 9 and j is 7. The value of (-i)/j could be either –1 or –2, depending on the implementation. On the other hand, the value of -(i/j) is always –1, regardless of the implementation. In C99, on the other hand, the value of (-i)/j must be equal to the value of -(i/j).  

*This problem is tricky and i will need to circle back to it to get a better understanding*

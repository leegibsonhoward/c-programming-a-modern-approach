Show the output produced by each of the following program fragments. Assume that i, j,
and k are int variables.  

```
(a) i = 7; j = 8;
    i *= j + 1;
    printf("%d %d", i, j);
(b) i = j = k = 1;
    i += j += k;
    printf("%d %d %d", i, j, k);
(c) i = 1; j = 2; k = 3;
    i -= j -= k;  j=-1 k=3
    printf("%d %d %d", i, j, k);
(d) i = 2; j = 1; k = 0;
    i *= j *= k;
    printf("%d %d %d", i, j, k);
```
output:  

a) 63 8  
b) 3 2 1
c) 2 -1 3 - this one is trick for me
d) 0 0 0 - 0 * any number is always zero
